# VibeVerse-Recommender
VibeVerse is a cross-domain, content-based recommender system designed to bridge the gap between music and literature.  Instead of just recommending books based on other books, or songs based on other songs, VibeVerse answers the question: "If this book was a song, what would it sound like?" and "If this song was a book, what would it be?"
